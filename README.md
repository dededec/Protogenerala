A simple game I made as a first project with Golang. 
In the game, you get five cards from a deck and need to get the biggest possible added value of the cards. 
During 3 rounds, you can change any number of cards from your hand for random ones from the deck.

There's room for improvement, but, as this was a really quick project, I am satisfied with the result.
